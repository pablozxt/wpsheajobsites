#Sheajobsites

This a project by Pablo Perez to create a responsive Twitter Bootstrap Wordpress theme for J.F.Shea Construction. 
This theme allows J.F.Shea to exchange information across job sites, dicuss challenges and showcase project progress.

##Acknowledgements

This theme has built from the blank theme [BlankSlate](http://wordpress.org/themes/blankslate) by TidyThemes

I'm a code newbie, so in order to build this project I have used components and code snippets from multiple developers, among others the following:

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [jQuery mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Fitvids](http://fitvidsjs.com/)
* Laz Creative's Justin Lazanowski's [code](http://lazcreative.com/blog/adding-swipe-support-to-bootstrap-carousel-3-0/) to make Boostrap's carousel touch responsive
* [Chris Coyier](http://css-tricks.com/) for all his CSS tricks and PHP functions to help customize Wordpress defaults and for his general awesomeness

##Recommended Plug-ins

For appropriate use of this theme, the following plug-ins are recommended:

* [Advanced Custom Fields][http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/]: Create a radio button with Field Name "display_on_home_slider" in order to select which posts will be displayed on the home page slider
